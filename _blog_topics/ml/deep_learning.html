<p>A subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on what is learned. Deep Learning approaches allow models to automatically learn from hierarchical features from data, making it effective for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</p>
<p>These algorithms learn and improve on their own, without the need for explicit programming of rules. The use of multiple layers of neurons allows for the algorithms to extract and process complex and hierarchical features from data, enabling them to make more accurate and nuanced predictions compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.</p>
