<p>I was raised in the small town of Colchester, where my programming adventure started during an apprenticeship. Focusing on front-end development and assisting in creating full-fledged WordPress websites, I found my love for problem-solving and building applications from the ground up.</p>
<p>After 4 years, I craved something new and moved away from web development. Pursing new career options, I enrolled in the <span class="blue">University of Lincoln</span> to obtain my BSc degree in <span class="blue">Computer Science</span>. In between assignments, I began taking online <span class="blue">Udacity</span> and <span class="blue">Udemy</span> courses, where I discovered a passion for <span class="blue">Machine Learning</span> and <span class="blue">AI</span>.</p>
<p>I continued my journey through an MSc degree in <span class="blue">Machine Learning and Autonomous Systems</span> at the <span class="blue">University of Bath</span>.</p>
<p>Personally, I love programming {% include page_parts/image.html url="code.png" alt="code icon" %} and playing chess {% include page_parts/image.html url="chess.png" alt="chess icon" -%}, and enjoy listening to music {% include page_parts/image.html url="spotify.png" alt="spotify icon" %} or watching a movie {% include page_parts/image.html url="movies.png" alt="movie ticket icon" %} when relaxing.</p>

<p>Currently, I spend most of my time building my skills in <span class="blue">Django</span> and <span class="blue">ReactJS</span> to further my career in Web Development. Where I am to specialise in integrating Machine Learning applications with web projects.</p>
